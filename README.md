Instructions
In a large bowl add in the melted butter, both sugars, eggs and vanilla extract and whisk together until combined.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with a spatula to form your cookie dough. IMPORTANT STEP: Now, chill the dough for a minimum of 2 hours before scooping to avoid the cookies from spreading while baking.
Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop the cookie dough base into roughly 14 cookies (weighing roughly 2 1/2 oz each)
